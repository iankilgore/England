  The quest to become a knight...
  A journey from boy to manhood

  Origins and types of Knights
  Knights have international counterparts around the world that have existed thorough out history
  Example: samurai
  Other countries had their own Knights or other types of equestrian warriors, like France, Germany, and even Ancient Rome
  Knights originate in the transition of many nations employing professional soldiers rather than an army of citizens
  While the concept of a superior warrior social class dates back to ancient cultures like the Romans, Babylonians, and even the ancient Persians, it's medieval form mostly comes from the social hierarchy established by the feudal system
  Needing men to make up his military as well as be his enforcers, William needed Knights... And Knights needed money
  Being a knight requires sizable personal wealth: keeping the land, purchasing and maintaining equipment as well as horses was expensive!
  Knights were the only class in feudal society that could, with effort and substantial luck and money, one could move into from any other station in life
  If a peasant was lucky and (somehow) wealthy, they could theoretically become a knight themselves
  (11th century) the origin of chivalry came out of monks that served with Knights, instilling them a moral code to diminish their bloodlust as soldiers
  Chivalry: gallantry, individual training, and service to others. Over time it's meaning has been refined to emphasize more ideals such as the knightly virtues of honor, courtly love, courtesy, and less martial aspects of the tradition.
  Basic categories of Knights
  Military classification: Knights originated as the foot soldiers of the feudal society; living and working in service to a king, as well as a lord, Earl, or Duke. These men kept order, enforced law, and waged war when necessary
  Chivalristic orders: following the crusades, (A series of holy wars), knighthood became more about honor and ceremony than military service
  Honorary knighthood: today, Knights are chosen by the queen for various extraordinary services to the British monarchy, such as arts, military, politics, etc...
  Stages of knighthood
  Family and connections: though it was possible to move up the social ladder into knighthood, most often, it had to be prearranged or handed down, like a right of passage
  Early childhood: the child of a knight would be groomed to take up the cause himself, in war games with wooden swords and longarms and shields, as well as hearing the 'legends of old', stories about the adventures Knights went on
  Page: A child is taken from the home at age 7 and so begins the 14 year process of becoming a knight of the realm
  A page was essentially a servant in the Knight's castle, caring for clothing, serving food, cleaning and maintain weapons and horse, or any other chore the knight required.
  All the while, the page could learn etiquette and battle wisdom from the knight though battle and strategy games, studying religion, hunting, riding, and manners
  Often, there were several pages of various ages in the castle at a given time. There would be a 'pecking order' based on age and favoritism. Eventually, pages move on to the squire stage at age 14.
  Squire: the most important steps to knighthood and started when a page reached the age of fourteen years old
  The duties of a squire were to learn about Chivalry, the rules of Heraldry, horsemanship, jousting, and practice the use of weapons and the skills required of a knight
  Also their duty to enter into the social life of the castle and learn courtly etiquette, music, and dancing. The squire served in this role for seven years and become a knight at the age of twenty-one
  Some squires, through extraordinary acts of valor, could earn a 'promotion' to knight status early
  Knights: the service, training, and years of dedication culminated in the knighthood ceremony. The squire would kneel and bow and then a knight, (or if they were lucky, a lord or a king, or queen) would christen them with a sword.
  The moment of truth came with three words, "Arise, Sir Knight."
