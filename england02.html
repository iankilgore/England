  Anglo-Saxon culture (400s-1000s AD)
  During the development of kingdoms after the Romans, significant culture began to bloom:
  Epic legends like Beowulf, and the Arthurian Legends
  Sophisticated metalwork in both art and technology
  Networks of castles as part of feudal system

  William I has conquered England after the Battle of Hastings and become the first king of England...
  He also retains his title of Duke of Normandy...
  His challenge: how to rule both areas?
  Two kingdoms
  William needed to return to Normandy to fulfill his duties as Duke, but did not want to lose his hard-fought control in England
  He needed a method or a system of ruling both places without being in two places at once
  His invention: the feudal system
  Feudal system: a set of legal and military customs in medieval Europe which (broadly defined) was a system for structuring society around relationships derived from holding of land in exchange for service or labor
  Feudalism would dictate the social hierarchy, forming a clear power vacuum that lead back to William I
  His advisors and commanders would keep order in his stead, collecting taxes and preventing any rebellion from boiling up
  William would be able to spend weeks at a time between France and England
  Travel was slow and arduous (difficult)
  William built his own castle to reign from- The Tower of London
  Tower of London: initially built by William as a symbol of the ruling elite, meant to communicate power and dominance over the English people... Was later used as a prison. From these two functions, it became a notorious figure in British lore, one that represented oppression and suffering.
  William mostly occupied the well-known 'White Tower'... And the people knew soldiers were ready to be dispatched from the castle if they disobeyed their king
  Under the Feudal system, William made social standing and power tied directly to land ownership
  William divided the land plots himself and 'gave' them to his lords and noblemen
  To receive the land, William's associates were forced to:
  Swear an oath of loyalty to William
  Collect taxes on the people in the area around their land
  Provide the king with soldiers if necessary
  Men remained loyal to William I out of fear:
  He was called 'conquerer' for a reason- he was a scary man
  Breaking a loyalty oath sworn on the bible would mean a one-way ticket to damnation
  Those in charge of land were dukes, earls, or lords... They would be known by those living on their land as tenant-in-chief
  The tenant-in-chief was the most important person in that tract of land
  For the earls, lords, and dukes, even the governing of their land was tricky
  However, payment must be passed along to the king, so...
  They would divide up their land amongst Knights... Called sub-tenants
  The Knight would swear an oath to the tenant-in-chief (and, in a way, to the King) and provide security and assure the collection of taxes was carried out without any problems.
