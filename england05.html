  In order, by most followers worldwide:
  Christianity
  Islam
  Non-religious (Atheists, Non-theists, agnostics)
  Buddhism
  Hinduism
  Judaism
  These are the leading religions in modern times...
  Islam
  Basic tenants: founded in 610 AD... An 'extension' of Christianity
  Founder Muhammad is visited by the archangel Gabriel who bestows upon him, the further text of God (called Allah), which was known as the Quran or Koran
  Islam split immediately after Muhammad died into two factions that could not decide on the direction of religion: Sunnis and Shiites
  Muslims worship in a mosque, their holy building for prayer and service
  Muslims have many rituals that involve praying and paying reverence to Allah:
  - 5 times a day (early, mid-morning, noon, afternoon, and evening) Muslims prostrate themselves towards Mecca (in Saudi Arabia) and offer prayers of respect and gratitude to Allah
  Islam has 5 pillars:
  +Prayer          +Pilgrimage
  +Alms giving  +Fasting
  +Testimony
  Judaism
  A far more ancient religion than Islam or Christianity, dating back to nearly 600 BC, to the 'Father of Judaism', Abraham
  Judaism is a religion focused on worship and reverence of God, or Yahweh
  -Yahweh can be portrayed as a harsh or even vengeful God
  There are numerous chapters of Jewish history with significance, including:
  Noah saving animals and man from a global flood
  Moses leading the enslaved Jews out of Egypt and bestowing the Ten Commandments
  (Yahweh's will and law) upon the people
  Judaism revolves around the law of the Ten Commandments, ranging in instructions about worshipping the one, true God (Yahweh) to rules that bar one from murder, theft, and jealousy
  Jewish boys and girls graduate into adulthood at age 13 with a bar mitzvah for boys, and bat mitzvah for girls... Ceremonies that mark their entrance into adulthood
  Other Jewish holidays of note: Rosh Shoshanna, Yom Kippur, and Hanukah
  Christianity originated around the transition between BC (before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini, Latin for 'the year of our lord') at the year ZERO
  After the life and sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, the Christian word was spread around the world by the followers of Jesus, men known as the Apostles, his 12 original followers
  Throughout history, Christianity has dominated the world's religious scene, and remains the most widely-practiced religion on the planet (for now; a combination of growing populations in Asia and rising Atheism in the Western World have lead to ________ becoming more popular widely practiced)
                      ISLAM
  Christianity was the most popular religion throughout Europe through the Middle Ages
  Remember! HALF OF ROME REMAINED CHRISTIAN AFTER THE EMPIRE SPLIT!
  The Christian church was also very POWERFUL in European Kingdoms
  -Kings were crowned by the Pope or an important Bishop in their home country
  -Kings and Queens often needed Church approval for certain decisions in their kingdoms and would be rendered useless without the Church's blessing
  Church in power
  The Christian church holds sway over the Kingdom and the people of Medieval times
  People are religious and fearful of God, Hell, and being punished for disobeying the word of God
  Taking advantage of their fear and the fact that peasants cannot read the Bible (a critical book that contains God's word) to themselves
  Over the centuries, (slowly but surely) the Church's abuse of power would lead to a massive split... But we'll get to that later
  Across Europe, one of the only groups with steady power was the church
  Kingdoms would rise and/or fall as time went by, but the church was not going anywhere... People depended on it to save their souls
  Church power had a distinct hierarchy:
  Pope in Rome, ultimate leader
  Cardinals, highest leaders in Rome and abroad, usually in major cities
  Bishops, local leaders in cities and some smaller communities
  Pastor/priest, local church leader
