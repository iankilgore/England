<h2>The doomsday book</h2>

  This system, while often harsh, insured loyalty and payments would be made to the king.
  His subjects often resented him and rarely liked him...
  but he conquered the country. They respected and (most importantly) obeyed him.
  William used precise record keeping to track what his subject owed him, from what taxes, and what they owned
  Used survey of people (took less than a year to interview all known subjects) to track who owed what
  Doomsday book: the book William I kept all tax and property records used in his kingdom; the book was said to bring 'doom and gloom' on his subjects due to unhappy tidings of paying taxes....
  However, it worked for the king because no subject could ever argue of dispute what they owned... It was in the book!
  As an artifact, the book gives great detail about various cities in the kingdom (examples: Sussex, Winchester... It left out major cities like London, in its early days)
  Provides a clear breakdown of the relative wealth (and by extension, the quality of life) throughout Medieval England
  William I benefitted little from the Doomsday Book (he died before the information could really be useful) but his successors would take full advantage of the book
  Summarizing
  To recap:
  Feudalism was a system devised by William I to better rule England when he was not there
  It put into the hands of the land-owning and established a social hierarchy
  William I used loyalty oaths and the threat of force to keep order
  William I used the Doomsday book to track what his subjects had and what they owed in taxes
