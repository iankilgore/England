  Britain is invaded by Germanic Anglo-Saxons (an ethnic group that would come to dominate this area and other parts of Europe).
  They fought and settled territories that eventually become kingdoms (400s AD to 1000s AD).
  Those kingdoms form what would become Britain and its surrounding kingdoms (Ireland, Scotland, Wales, etc).
  NOTEABLE INVADER: William the conqurer, Duke of Normandy (1066)
  He successfully ruled all of England after winning the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and became KING WILLIAM I.
  William and his followers were able to seize power for a few reasons:
  Much of Britain was unorganized and vulnerable to invasion and subjugation after the Romans left and Angio-Saxons moved in.
  Subjugation- the process or act of taking s place and/or people over
  He was already in a position of some power (Duke of Normandy) before declaring himself king
  William installed a feudal system to repress any potential revolt or unrest

  FEUDAL SYSTEM: society structured on the basis of land ownership/wealth and social standing.
  His reign would mark the beginning of the Middle Ages in England (1000-1500 AD)
